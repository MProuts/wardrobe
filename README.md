# Wardrobe

This is a project I built as a student at the Flatiron School.  The idea was to implement a web version of the clothing manager that Cher uses in the 1995 film "Clueless."

Users can upload pictures of their clothing articles, then mix and match them using stacked javascript photo sliders.

The project was implemented using Sinatra.
